### Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

### Probelm 2

``` r
cvd <- read.csv("accel_data.csv", header = TRUE) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_prefix = "activity_", 
    names_to = "minute", 
    values_to = "activity"
    ) %>%
mutate(wdorwe = case_when(day == 'Saturday' | day == 'Sunday' ~ 'weekend', day == 'Monday' | day == 'Tuesday' | day == 'Wednesday' | day == 'Thursday' | day == 'Friday' ~ 'weekday')) %>%
mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute))
```

##### In the accel_data dataset, there are 50400 observations and 6variables. The main varibales include week, day_id, day of the week, weekday or weekend, and activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

``` r
cvdsum <- cvd %>% 
group_by(week, day) %>% 
summarise(activity_sum = sum(activity)) %>% 
knitr::kable(
    catpion = "Total activity variable for each day"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
cvdsum
```

##### From the total activity over the day by week and day of the week, we can see there are more activities per day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday compared to other days of the week for most weeks.

``` r
plotcvd <- cvd %>% ggplot(aes(x = minute/60, y = activity, color = day)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    x = "Hours",
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c (0,24)),
    y = "Activity", 
    title = "24-hour activity panel for each day",
    caption = "single-panel plot"
  )

ggsave("plotcvd.png")
```

\##### From the plot above, we can see most of the activities are around
8-9pm in the evening. There are also more activity in morning time
7-10am and 4-5pm in the afternoon compare to other times.

### Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")

noaa <- ny_noaa %>% janitor::clean_names() 
```

##### The ny_noaa dataset includes 2595176 observations and 7 variables including: id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin. Missing values are seen largly in variables. There are 145838 missing values for variable `prcp`. There are 381221 missing values for the variable `snow`. There are 591786 missing values for the variable `snwd`. There are 1134358 missing values for the variable `tmax`. There are 1134420 missing values for the variable `tmin`.

``` r
noaa <- noaa %>% 
separate(col = date, into = c('Year','Month','Day'), sep = '-') 

noaa <- noaa %>% mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax), tmin = as.numeric(tmin),
tmin = tmin / 10, tmax = tmax / 10) %>% 
filter(prcp >= "0", snow >= "0", snwd >= "0")

countsnowfall <- noaa %>% count(snow)

countsnowfall
```

    ## # A tibble: 271 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 1782135
    ##  2     3    7502
    ##  3     5    8254
    ##  4     8    8317
    ##  5    10    4411
    ##  6    13   19281
    ##  7    15    3189
    ##  8    18    2723
    ##  9    20    3934
    ## 10    23    1737
    ## # … with 261 more rows

##### From the table above, we can see the most common snowfall report is 0 (n=1782135). It is because NY does not have snowfall on most of the days. The second most common is 3mm snowfall with n = 7502.

``` r
noaa_avg_max_temp <- noaa %>% 
  mutate(Month = as.numeric(Month)) %>% 
  group_by(id, Year, Month) %>% 
  filter(Month %in% c(1, 7)) %>% 
  summarize(meantmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE, color = id)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = meantmax, group = id)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
    geom_line(alpha = 0.25) + 
    facet_grid(. ~ Month) +
    labs(title = 
           "The average maximum temperature in January and in July in each station across years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average maximum temperature") 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'Year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r

\##### In general, the max tempature in July is higher than January. We
can see the outliers in January is more than the outliers in July. And
max tempature in January fluate more than that of July.

``` r
tmaxtmin <- noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) +
